And the world would move on without you, would it not?

Their souls shift, the forests grow and decay. Friends and enemies, living and dying, not at your hand.

Until you are nothing more than simple art, nature, of such a beautiful world. Another ambience.

Let me remake you, and mend you, and you can be so much more.

_The art that creates art._
