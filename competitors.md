# Cherry
**Tier** : Fodder
**Weight** : None
**Health** : 600
Cherries, along with Pits, are the only fodder competitors. They are aerial enemies that commonly appear in groups, moving a small distance creating a line of projectiles before firing.

The swaying movements they make result in 4 danmaku-like orb projectiles, each dealing 20 normal damage, which all fire at the current player position when they next sway with a slight acceleration effect. Damaging cherries makes them do these movements constantly with no break, resulting in more projectiles. As a base, they move every 1 second upon detecting the player. Otherwise, they float around aimlessly.

It's eye is its weakpoint. It has no breakpoints, however cratering it will kill it instantly.

Cherries are based upon the eye motif present in weirdcore. They are vaguely angelic, with a head resembling an glaucomic eye. Beneath the eye is an umbrella of cloth-like material, largely grey with an elaborate patterning, giving the simulation of a dress. Two long strings of light reach out from the dress, and visually the projectiles created spawn from the dress.

Upon being killed, a cherry will release a Pit. This does not apply if killed via cratering.

## Pit
**Tier** : Fodder
**Weight** : None
**Health** : 1
Pits are aerial enemies that float quickly around the map, always in curved paths, and constantly shoot projectiles. These typically only spawn upon the death of a Cherry, not often spawning on their own.

The projectiles deal 15 light damage, and are fired every third of a second. The projectiles originate from empty space around the eye.

When they spawn, they have 2 seconds of immunity frames, but can otherwise be killed in one hit.

It has no breakpoints or weakpoints.

Pits take the form of barely real or coherent eyes, with a randomly colored flat glow surrounding them. Each one's model is given random shading and lighting, often not following the design rules of the game. They always face the player.
